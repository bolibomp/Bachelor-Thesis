The reaction–diffusion equation (RDE) is a natural way of describing a system
where there is not only diffusion but also interaction with its surroundings. The
RDE has been the topic of interest in previous papers for its usefulness of explaining
pattern formations in nature. The static RDE has, in one dimension, the form of a
Newton equation. We study a discretized version of this equation, with applications
in biology (where a cell can be seen a natural discretization), economics, and computer simulations. In particular we consider a class of discretized Newton equations
that allows for a conserved quantity. Using this we manage to find a conservative
discretization of the Φ4
system.
